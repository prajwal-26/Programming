// you can write code on one system and run it on another without modification. 
//The .class file is a compiled bytecode file that can be executed on any system with a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

// Compilation: Java source code (.java files) needs to be compiled into bytecode (.class files) before it can be executed.
// The compilation process translates your human-readable Java code into a format that the JVM can understand and execute.

//Execution: The JVM executes the bytecode stored in .class files. When you run a Java program, 
//the JVM loads the appropriate .class files and executes the code they contain.

//.class files are essential because they contain the compiled bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine.
// They facilitate platform independence, code optimization, security, and the ability to distribute Java applications without revealing the source code.
